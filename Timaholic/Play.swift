/**
 *  When to get the location from the user?
 *  Should the location continuosly?
 *  If yes, how frequently
 *  If no, track location as soon as user clicks CREATE-CHECKIN-BUTTON
 *  Now you have the latitude and longitude
 *  There is already an existing list of permitted locations for the user
 *  Check if the obtained lat and lon are in this list(google on searching for locations)
 *  If it is present, perform segue, display the corresponding company name in the view controller
 *  If not present, two scenarios
 *      1. Throw an alert dialogue(Location not permitted) and not move to the next screen
 *      2. If that is not a good method, ask giri what to do.. (You can still go to the next view 
 *         controller and disable user interation for the CHECKIN-BUTTON
 *  Store the location in user defaults.
 *  What if the user clicks CREATE-CHECKIN-BUTTON, goes to the next view controller and comes out of the place?
 *  So, when the user clicks CHECKIN-BUTTON, check for location again, or keep tracking location continuosly in the CHECKIN-VIEW-CONTROLLER. If the user comes out automatically do something about it.
